# 🎓 Object-Oriented Programming Assignment

> A Python project demonstrating OOP concepts through a **Superhero System** and **Vehicle Polymorphism**.

**Requirements:** Python 3.7+ | **Topics:** Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

---


## 📋 What's Inside

### Assignment 1: Superhero Class System 🦸‍♂️

- **Base Class**: `Superhero` with power levels and abilities
- **Inheritance**: `FlyingHero`, `StrengthHero`, `TechHero`
- **Features**: Encapsulation, training system, gadget management

### Assignment 2: Vehicle Polymorphism 🚗

- **Same Method, Different Behaviors**: All vehicles have `move()` but behave uniquely
- **Vehicle Types**: Car (driving), Plane (flying), Boat (sailing), Bicycle (pedaling), Spaceship (space travel)

## 📊 Example Output

**Assignment 1:**
```
Superman (Clark Kent) - Power: 95/100 - Status: Active
Superman uses Super Strength & Flight while flying majestically!
```

**Assignment 2:**
```
🚗 Tesla Model S is driving on the road at 155 mph
✈️ Boeing 747 is flying through the sky at 570 mph
```
